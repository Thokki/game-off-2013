## "Changing of the Seasons"

Winter. Winter never changes. We find our hero **Alfonso "The Nuts" McSquirrel** facing the coldest winter yet with no stash of food.



[Play the game](https://webviking.co.uk/github-gameoff/)

## Gameplay

Your main goal is to deliver enough nuts to your nest to survive the winter. The weather is changing fast, so keep your eye on the timer.

![Bears](http://webviking.co.uk/github-gameoff/github/bear.png) **Bears**, the forest bullies that don't want to play ball

![Nuts](http://webviking.co.uk/github-gameoff/github/collectables.png) **Nuts**, you might want to collect these, it'll come handy over long freezing winter

![Nest](http://webviking.co.uk/github-gameoff/github/home.png) **Your nest**, you can store any nuts you find here

## Controls
